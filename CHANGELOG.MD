# 1.3.0
By Hamzah
Built for CK3 1.13.* (Basileus)

## Fixes
    - Update decisions for CK 1.13.* (pictures and decision groups)
    - Fix tribal government decisions not also changing vassal government as well

## Changes
    - Tribal decision now has cost, not effect of lost piety, so you need the 150 prestige to do it

## Features
    - Add decision to switch between Feudal and Clan, and vice versa
