# Change Government Type

- Change Government Type is a simple mod for Crusader Kings 3 that adds a decision to change government type (when you are a tribal)

- This replaces the Vanilla "Adopt Feudal/Clan Ways" Decision for players, with a decision that allows them to choose either Fuedal or Clan.

- Also allows the player to freely use the "Revert to Tribal Government" decision.

- Normally, you are locked into Clan Government when playing as an Islamic Faith and Feudal Government when playing any other kind of Faith, this change to the decision simply lets you choose instead.

- Uses Vanilla logic when adopting new governments, including creating new temples/cities and changing Vassal Government types.

- The AI will continue to use the Vanilla decision to change their government types, it is simply hidden from the player, This mod changes the decisions "convert_whole_realm_to_feudalism_decision" and "convert_to_tribalism_decision" in "common/decisions/80_major_decisions" so will conflict if another mod changes these decisions as well (this is very unlikely!)

- English localisation only right now

- The Mod is currently hosted on the Steam Workshop, at [ChangeGovernmentType](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2903726036)
