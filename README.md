# ChangeGovernmentType
    Change Government Type, a simple mod for Crusader Kings 3 that adds a decision to change government type
    This replaces the Vanilla "Adopt Feudal/Clan Ways" Decision for players, with a decision that allows them to choose either Fuedal or Clan
    Uses Vanilla logic when adopting new governments, including creating new temples/cities and changing Vassal Government types.
